# React Calculator 

## Introduction

- I created this project based on the tutorial "Create a simple calculator app in React" by Krissanawat Kaewsanmuang.

## How to install and use it?

- Download the files, cd into directory and run:
  - npm install
  - npm start
- After running the app, perform operations like a normal calculator.
- Invalid expressions crash the app.
